# <h1 align=center> About this project

The Project had the purpose of showing the number of orders that the company had between January 2022 until September 2023. There was a need to know how much income was obtained in each month as well as profits by location and product category.

There are 50 stores throughout 29 cities, distributed in 4 types of locations (Airport, Commercial, Downtown and Residential).

There are 35 products, classified into 5 categories (Art & Crafts, Electronics, Games, Sports & Outdoors and toys).

The insights are the following:

In general, increasing income is observed throughout the period of time studied.
There were gains throughout the analyzed time range (January 2022 to September 2023) in all product categories and all locations.

"Toys" is the product category that has more orders, but "Arts & Crafts" is the one that has the highest profit.

Stores that have run out of stock of some of their products: Aguascalientes, Chilpancingo, Ciudad Victoria, Cuernavaca, Culiacán, Guadalajara, La Paz, Mérida, Mexicali, Morelia, Oaxaca, Pachuca, San Luis Potosí, Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Villahermosa and Zacatecas.

Made with Power BI.
