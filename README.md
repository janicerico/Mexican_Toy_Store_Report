The Project had the purpose of showing the number of orders that the company had between January 2022 until September 2023. There was a need to know how much income was obtained in each month as well as profits by location and product category.

There are 50 stores throughout 29 cities, distributed in 4 types of locations (Airport, Commercial, Downtown and Residential).

There are 35 products, classified into 5 categories (Art & Crafts, Electronics, Games, Sports & Outdoors and toys).

The insights are the following:

In general, increasing income is observed throughout the period of time studied.
There were gains throughout the analyzed time range (January 2022 to September 2023) in all product categories and all locations.
